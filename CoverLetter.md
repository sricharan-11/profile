-  I am not gonna take more than 20 seconds of yours.

-  This is a redirection you've taken to look at my portfolio. 

-  I am a Solution Architect (specialisation - Cloud); Product Manager (specialisation - empathy & integrations). 

-  **I have hands-on experience in:**
choosing Techstacks, Cloud Solutioning, deployments in Kubernetes with CI/CD, BCDR planning, OSS implementations, Automation Scriptings, IaCs, Operational standardisations with KPI improvement, OKR fixations.
-  **As a Product Owner:**
I have used the MoSCoW method and incorporated stunning features relying on the empathetic parts of the user feedback to improve user experience of large scale SaaS CRM.

-  More details are incorporated in the resume [linked here, click here](https://github.com/sricharan-11/profile/blob/main/Resume-SriCharan.pdf). _Reload the browser if this link is showing an error, github should render it for sure._

-  Being responsible and reliable puts me off-beat.
